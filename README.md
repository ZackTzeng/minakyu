# 💸 Minakyu: みな給 - 大家的薪水 💸

😻 Everyone deserves a raise! 😻

This Minakyu is an zkApp that takes your private employee compensation info (and keep it private using zero knowledge proof and verification) and tells you if you are underpaid. It will the connect you with recruiters and head-hunters who can give you a better opportunity. Annoynmous aggregation can also be used by organizations to study and prevent discrimation against gender, ethnicity, disability, age... etc. 
Note: we've just started building.... this repo is not complete... there's a lot more to come! P.S. if you are interested in the project, reach out to us!

Thanks to organizers, volunteers and sponsors of Taipei Blockchain Week!
